# MBTI-Personality-Predictor

Predicting Personality Types based on Social Media Posts

# Overview
This project aims to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types using machine learning techniques. The algorithm analyzes users' social media posts and classifies them into specific personality traits, including Introversion/Extroversion, Intuition/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving.

# Key Features
1) Text Analysis: Utilized Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text analysis, implementing a bag-of-words model to extract meaningful features from social media posts.
2) Custom Dataset Preprocessing: Engineered a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, remove stop words, reduce dimensioanlity and ensure data consistency.
3) Classifier Training: Trained a Naive Bayes classifier for text classfication using NLTK's NaiveBayesClassifier.
4) Feature Representation: Implemented Bag of Words model for efficient feature representation.
5) Testing and Evaluation: Conducted rigorous testing and evaluation, achieving a high accuracy of 75% on unseen data which is quite good for basic Naive Bayes
